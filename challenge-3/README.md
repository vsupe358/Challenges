Challenge #3

We have a nested object. We would like a function where you pass in the object and a key and get back the value.
The choice of language and implementation is up to you.

Example Inputs
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a

Hints:
We would like to see some tests.
A quick read to help you along the way - We would expect it in any other language apart from elixir.



#First things first - Why Node?
Node is just a javascript code that doesn't have stringly typed data structures, which makes it hard and every fucntion input needs to be validated befofe doing any compute on it. I found it challenging to ensure that all the edge cases are covered during the input validation

#Approach
Define a function that takes two parameters named

object : the full JSON object keys : an Array of keys in the order

#Assumptions
There will be at least one key to search
Any invalid key will return null
The Keys are given in the order as it would appear in the JSON tree
Testing
I am going to use Mocha javascript testing framework to do the unit testing

#Compute complexity
Space Complexity O(1)
Time Complexity O(N) where N is the depth of the tree.

#Environment
Clone the project
Install dependencies
npm install

#Test the project
npm test
