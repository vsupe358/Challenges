Challenge #3

We have a nested object. We would like a function where you pass in the object and a key and get back the value.
The choice of language and implementation is up to you.

Example Inputs
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a

Hints:
We would like to see some tests.
A quick read to help you along the way - We would expect it in any other language apart from elixir.
